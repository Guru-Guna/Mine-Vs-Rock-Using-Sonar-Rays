# Mine-Vs-Rock-Using-Sonar-Rays

        Sonar, short for Sound Navigation and Ranging, uses sound waves to navigate, communicate, and detect objects underwater. Sonar rays refer to the emitted sound waves, often in the form of pulses, that travel through water and bounce off objects. By analyzing the returning echoes, sonar systems can determine the distance, size, shape, and composition of underwater objects, helping in navigation, mapping, and locating submerged targets.

# Features

        - Longitudinal Waves: Sonar waves are longitudinal waves, meaning they travel through the water by compressing and decompressing the water molecules along the direction of the wave.

        - Frequency Range: Sonar waves can have a wide range of frequencies. Higher frequencies provide better resolution for detecting small objects, while lower frequencies can penetrate deeper into the water.

        - Echo Analysis: Sonar systems analyze the returning echoes to determine the distance, direction, and characteristics of underwater objects. The time delay and intensity of the echoes provide valuable information.

        - Directional Propagation: Sonar waves can be directed and focused in specific directions, allowing for targeted exploration of underwater areas.

        - Refraction and Reflection: Sonar waves can be refracted or bent as they travel through water layers with different properties. Reflection occurs when the waves encounter an object, bouncing back towards the source.

        - Doppler Effect: The Doppler effect can be used in sonar to detect the motion of underwater objects. It involves analyzing the frequency shift of the returning echoes to determine whether an object is moving towards or away from the sonar source.
